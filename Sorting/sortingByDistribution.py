# Types of sorting by distribution: Counting, Radix, Bucket
# Counting Sort: O(n + k) time | O(n + k) space
# Code:

    for i in array:

# Explanation of sorting by distribution:
# Counting Sort: Count the number of elements with distinct key values, 
# and use arithmetic to determine the position of each key value in the output sequence.
# Radix Sort: Sort the elements by first grouping the individual digits of the same place value.
# Then, sort the elements according to their increasing/decreasing order.
# Bucket Sort: Distribute the elements of an array into a number of buckets.
# Each bucket is then sorted individually, either using a different sorting algorithm,
# or by recursively applying the bucket sorting algorithm.


# More Explanation on Bucket Sort:
# Bucket sort is mainly useful when input is uniformly distributed over a range.
# For example, consider the following problem.
# Sort a large set of floating point numbers which are in range from 0.0 to 1.0 and are uniformly distributed across the range.
# How do we sort the numbers efficiently?
# A simple way is to apply a comparison based sorting algorithm.
# The lower bound for Comparison based sorting algorithm (Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Quick-Sort .. etc) is Î©(n Log n),
# i.e., they cannot do better than nLogn.
# Can we sort the array in linear time? Counting sort can not be applied here as we use keys as index in counting sort.
# Here keys are floating point numbers.
# The idea is to use bucket sort.
# Following is bucket algorithm.
# bucketSort(arr[], n)
# 1) Create n empty buckets (Or lists).
# 2) Do following for every array element arr[i].
# .......a) Insert arr[i] into bucket[n*array[i]]
# 3) Sort individual buckets using insertion sort.
# 4) Concatenate all sorted buckets.
# The time complexity of bucket sort is O(n + k) with O(n) space.
# The space complexity can be reduced further by using linked lists instead of arrays to represent buckets.
# The space complexity of bucket sort is O(n).
# The main disadvantage of bucket sort is that it is not suitable for sorting large data sets.
